<ApiBanner />

The Moralis API automatically enriches all transactions, NFT transfers and ERC20 transfers with user-friendly labels for the sender and the receiver. Any transaction or transfer that includes a `to_address` or `from_address` will also include `to_address_label` and `from_address` labels respectively.

These labels reflect publicly known addresses such as `Coinbase`, `Binance`, `Kraken`, as well as DEXes such as `Uniswap v3`, `1inch`, and also NFT marketplaces like `OpenSea` and `Blur`, plus many more!

Here's an example transaction:

```
{
  "hash": "0x70c30285a9a4cc1c147cc94e5d0cefebe693fffd5fd5cbf727e2f86b6829d71b",
